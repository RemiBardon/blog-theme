/* FIX: Just a workaround for places where a list of pages contains only empty
     sections. Happens mainly when a pinned section contains only drafts. */
/* NOTE: Doesnâ€™t fix the issue if the section itself has an empty section. */
/* NOTE: Not a problem when CSS is disabled since lists use margins by default
     in most browsers. Margins can collapse if the element has no height. */
